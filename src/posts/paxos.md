### Why Paxos?

Paxos is a Greek island in the Ionian Sea, lying just south of Corfu. I've never been, but I read extremely positive things. Now, the Paxos family of protocols, designed for solving consensus in a network of unreliable processors, was named after that small island, some miles of Greece's west coast.
