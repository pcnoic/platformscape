        <p>Greetings, fellow travelers on this vast and wondrous journey we call life! Allow me to introduce myself - I am
        Christos, a craftsman of code and a dreamer of digital realms.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I have devoted myself to the study and practice of building resilient and predictable systems that solve problems
        and improve the world around us.</p>
        <br />
        <p>But my work is not just about the technicalities of code - it is about bringing a little bit of magic and wonder into the world.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
            I have been fortunate enough to work with some very talentend people. I started my career writing Java code for <a target="_blank" href="https://comidor.com">Comidor</a> and quickly transitioned
            into DevOps. I was responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure that supported the company's core product. Helping engineers own their code and making sure that it was running smoothly in production and developing
            documentation for ISO 27001 compliance.   
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Being an informal university dropout, I was still able to get a short internship at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> where I worked on a project that was later integrated into GCP's <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/anthos">Anthos</a> platform.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            I moved back in Greece and worked in cloud infrastructure for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.alfaview.com/">Alfaview</a> in a team of stellar engineers. We were ensuring that the company's core product was running smoothly in production and that the infrastructure was scalable and resilient.
            We spread our services across multiple cloud providers and integrated a lot of tooling to make sure that we were able to monitor and troubleshoot our systems
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            In 2022, I founded <a target="_blank" href="https://podbeam.io">Podbeam</a> where we're helping podcasters and content creators to build their dream podcast and grow their audience.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>So join me on this incredible journey, and together let us explore the endless
        possibilities of platform engineering.</p>
